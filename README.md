# DNA Sequence Analysis with Biopython

This project contains basic operations on a DNA sequence using the `Biopython` library.  
It is a great starting point for students and beginners in bioinformatics who want to learn how to:

- Work with DNA sequences
- Find complements and reverse complements
- Transcribe DNA to RNA
- Translate DNA to proteins
- Count nucleotide frequencies
- Calculate GC content
- Search for subsequences
- Compare two DNA sequences

## ðŸ“š Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Biopython library

Install Biopython using pip if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install biopython
```
